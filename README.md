how to compile your program : When you run the program after include "Input1.txt" file, it will read the infix
                              in the first line as expression 1 and check if it is valid or not. If that infix
                              is valid, the program will convert to postfix.
example of output :

Expression 1 : 
Infix exp: a-b/(c+d-e)*(f^g*h+i)
Valid
Postfix exp:abcd+e-/fg^h*i+*-
Expression 2 :
Infix exp: 1+2+3^4**
Not-Valid
